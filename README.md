# Effective_C
Repo to document what I've learned from Robert C. Seacord's book "Effective C".

Chose this book since it not only teaches C, it teaches to write "professional, portable and secure" C programs.

I chose C in order to gain a deep lower-level understanding of high level languages and unlock new super powers with low level system interactions. :)
